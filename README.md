# WaterReminder

Welcome to the Jetpack Compose and WearOS Data Transfer Example Project! This repository contains a collection of sample code showcasing the capabilities of Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI, along with demonstrating data transfer between WearOS and Android devices.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to provide developers with practical examples of utilizing diverse Compose features and components. Furthermore, the project emphasizes the implementation of data transfer functionality between WearOS and Android devices, offering insights into seamless communication across these platforms.
