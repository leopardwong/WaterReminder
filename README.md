# WaterReminder

Welcome to the WaterReminder project! This repository is a collection of sample code designed to demonstrate the power of Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit. Additionally, it showcases the seamless data transfer capabilities between WearOS and Android devices, exemplifying effective communication between these platforms.

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to provide developers with practical examples of utilizing various Jetpack Compose features and components. Furthermore, it offers insights into implementing data transfer functionality between WearOS and Android devices, enabling a fluid exchange of information.
